### Article: [My Summer as a Software Engineering Intern at Pinterest Toronto!](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/my-summer-as-a-software-engineering-intern-at-pinterest-toronto-a0857bf8cf98)


Reading Khubi Shah's article about her internship experience at Pinterest really caught my eye, especially since I'm a junior studying computer science and looking to dive into the tech world soon. What really grabbed me was how she got to work on a team that mixes software engineering and machine learning. That's a dream gig for me! I totally related to how she prepared for the role by taking specialized courses and grinding on algorithm challenges. It made me feel like I'm on the right track with my own plans.

I was also really into the way she talked about the balance between learning from mentors and owning her own projects. It sounds like Pinterest gives you the freedom to actually make a difference, not just fetch coffee or do busywork. I've been reading up on agile methods in my courses, so hearing that she got hands-on experience with that stuff during her internship was super encouraging. It's a good nudge for me to look for internships that let me get my hands dirty with real projects and learn from the pros at the same time.
